      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      To secure your website from web security attacks there are several
      different criterias that has to be fulfilled to ensure your website is
      safe. First of all you have to make sure you are using HTTPS and not HTTP.
      HTTPS provides encryption for all data between the user and the website
      and it gives you priority over HTTP by Google. To make sure your website
      stays safe for SQL injection attacks you can create a boundary in your
      website that does not allow the insertion of code into the website. It can
      also be smart for big companies to buy domains with very similar names to
      prevent from Cross-site scripting. It is also important for every person
      with access to the website code uses appropriate security measures like 2
      factor authentication etc, this ensures protection against other types of
      attacks.
