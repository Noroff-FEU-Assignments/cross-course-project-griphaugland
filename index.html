      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      HTTP does not properly encrypt data sent to the client from the server and
      the other way around. That is why we have HTTPS which encrypts this data
      making it a lot more secure.
